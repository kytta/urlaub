# urlaub

> URL, and useful bits, for Python

URLaub (/ˈuːɐ̯ˌlaʊ̯p/; German: "vacation") is a library that makes working with URLs and URIs simpler. What `pathlib` is to `os.path`, `urlaub` strives to be for `urllib.parse`: easy-to-use and foolproof Pythonic APIs for URL parsing, unparsing, and validation.
